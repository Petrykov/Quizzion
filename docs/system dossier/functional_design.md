### 1. Background
The “Quizzion” is already an existing application that was developed recently by another team of developers. 
Now the owner of the company wants to have a newly created application with the same purpose but with a few different requirements. 
There’s already an existing database in a combination of APIs and documentation on how to use is given by the company. 
The topics to improve from a previous version: design, functionality, animation.   

The new version of the app is expected to be finished in 8 weeks. In this project there’ll be three sprint stages: 0,1,2,3; 
During the 0-stage team will focus on the proper list of requirements, mockups. 
1st sprint is about frontend implementation - connection to the vuex and also starting with the backend. 
At the 2nd sprint, we’ll fully connect frontend to the backend and will add some tests to verify that everything works as expected.
In the last sprint, we will finalize the projects with some refinements and 20% tasks.
