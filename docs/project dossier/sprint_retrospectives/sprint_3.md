# Sprint 3 retrospective

Date: June 15, 2020 - Jun 28, 2020

Scrum master: Vy Tran


#### What did we do?

At the end of sprint 2, we did not finish implementing API results and web socket.
Those were 2 critical tasks to finalize the project. Therefore, we decided to prioritize those tasks.

Besides, documentation update was also important. We updated functional and technical designs, API doc, user manuals,project dossier and research document (which also includes 20% individual competence).

Each member also focused on our own 20% individual development competence. Victor was working on researching and implementing AWS hosting and testing, so that we could host frontend and backend on AWS.
Vlad was focusing on AWS integration. Katarzyna was working on Eslint. Mark was responsible for web socket research and implementation. Tien and Vy decided to be in charged of UX, UI design, so its almost finished on sprint 1.

We also implemented 2 extra screen (frontend), which are podium screen to show the winners and statistic dashboard for quiz master. We agreed that we only connected statistic dashboard to Vuex dummy data,
and recommend it as a MUST HAVE function for Quizzion version 3 implementation. 

Most of the part of the products were deployed and connected, but we want to give a perfect and complete product to our client, so we also have some tasks for frontend and backend refinement, fix some bug.

Finally, we had a meeting about how to show our product in the last demo and win the project


#### What went well?

Despite the late reply from the client about how we can implement API to add and get new results from the quiz respondents, we managed to implement API result quite fast. 
At nearly the end of the first week of sprint 3, API results and web socket were already implemented and working nicely.  

We still keep meeting every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and even Saturday to update our progress. 
Besides, if anyone in the team needs help from other members, we also made room for that immediately. 
Therefore, we are proud to say our group's communication and collaboration went pretty well.

For the second week of sprint 3, we managed to host our products on AWS, so that we could play quiz with our coach teacher and with our contact person
from Paration (Kris).

We were able to show the winners of the quiz on podium screen and managed to finish the statistic dashboard connected with vuex.

#### What can we improve on?

For the last sprint, we did not have any big question for our client. However, we hope that if we could have chance to work together again with Paration, they can put more focus on the project progress
and reply our concerns as soon as possible so that we can keep track of our progress.

We have nothing to complain, but a big compliment to our collaboration, especially during corona outbreak. 
We think we could even make it better if we could meet up in person for group discussion.
