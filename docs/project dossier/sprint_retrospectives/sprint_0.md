# Sprint 0 retrospective

Date: May 06, 2020 - May 16, 2020

Scrum master: Tien Thai



#### What did we do?

In sprint 0, our prioritized aspects are analyzation and  designs. This included analyzing client's requirements and proposing software solution design. The sprint acted as a preparation step of the project, so we wanted to make sure the initial phase covers all the necessary documentation and analytical report. 

To start off, we focused on setting up the project properly: Deciding on contact person/product owner from our end, agreeing with the client on their end contact person, preparing questions and raising concern to ask the client during kick-off meeting. We also agreed in the team to set up proper communication tools, a group chat and Microsoft Team for daily stand-ups. After that, we divided the tasks among team member to finish different parts of the PoA. We also described our 60% software competence, and also looked into the 20% competence that outside of software scope, in order to make use of this 20% throughout the project. 

One of the important part of this phase is doing research and getting familiar with the technique we will be using. All the team members started to learn about Quasar and VueJS. We have 2 team members in charge of Web Socket research, 2 on Designs research, and 2 on AWS research. 


#### What went well?

The communication in the team was efficient and effective. We had stand-up everyday and also had a lot of one-on-one meeting (sometime 3-people meeting) to finish a certain given task. This increased our works' quality as it would be reviewed properly by different member, avoiding bias or misleading content in the documentation. 

We handed in the PoA on time and got good feedback from the project coach. The research were well-documented and we had proper starting point with Functional and Technical designs, which helped us later in the coming sprint to start working on the technical side of the project.


#### What can we improve on?

Due to small problem with communication with the client, we didn't always get the answers we needed on time. This cause problem in finalizing the technical designs, which is an essential part of the project. We ended the sprint with some unanswered questions and concern, and this could be improved by reaching out to the client either sooner, meaning we have to do much closer analyzation on their getting started doc, or contacting and remind them on a daily basis. 

We also had some problems in deciding the weight/point of an user story. Problem was it took too much time to go over everyone in the group's opinion and then get the average point. We could improve this by setting up an excel table for everyone to fill in the number of point they think would fit certain user story
