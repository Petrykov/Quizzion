# Sprint 2
Date: Jun 2, 2020 - Jun 14, 2020
Scrum master: Katarzyna Strozykowska


## What went well?

During the second Sprint we decided to focus on the connection between our frontend and the backend from Parantion. First week we split up our group into two smaller (3 people each).
First group was working on the frontend part of the project. They prepared two pages ( results for respondent and moderator) and finished connecting everything with Vuex. They also improved our frontend by fixing styling and added animations.
Second group was working on the backend. Because we didn’t have a clear explanation about the Parantion’s backend, working on the API took much more time than we expected. Fortunately we were able to finish CRUD functions for quizzes, questions and answers. After that, in the second week, we began the most important task for this sprint – connection between frontend and backend.  We manage to connect most of the pages with Parantion’s backend.
Additionally we provided extra functionality for the quizzes and questions. It is possible now to upload or edit a logo for a quiz and an image for a questions. All the images are stored in Firebase. 

It is worth to mention that the communication between the group’s members is really good. Everyone attended daily stand-ups and remained active during all the discussions. During the connection process we decided to work in a pair-programming system (one person from frontend and one person from backend team), which made our work really effective and efficient.

## What went less well? 
As I mention before, we spent too much time working on the connection with the backend from Parantion. The documentation, which we got from the client, was not clear enough. 
What is more, at the end of the sprint we discover a problem, which could affect the whole project – we couldn’t get quiz’s results. On Wednesday, during our meeting the client (Kris Minkjan), we talked with him about this problem and we emphasized that it’s important part of the project and we need to find the solution as fast as possible. He said that soon we will get an email with an explanation how we can solve the problem. However we had to wait until Monday evening (Sprint 3) for his reply. Because of that, we were not able to connect results pages with Parantion’s backend during the Sprint 2. 

Secondly, we were concentrated on API calls and we didn’t have enough time to implement websockets. At the end of the sprint we had only a separate project with a basic implementation of web sockets. We had to move this task to the next Sprint.

Additionally, we had almost two days delay, because we blocked the login functionality (we provided wrong password too many times). We asked the client (Kris Minkjan) to reset the user account for us, but he forgot to do it. We had to call to the company.

Moreover, we got a wrong information about the date of the presentation. We had only two hours to prepare a presentation and a demo for the client.

## What could be improved? 
Most of the problems were caused by poor communication with the client. It takes some time, before we receive any replay from the client. Some answers are not clear enough. Maybe it would be better if we could reach the client via phone.
