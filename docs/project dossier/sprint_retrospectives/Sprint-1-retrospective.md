# Sprint 1 retrospective

Date: May 18, 2020 - Jun 2, 2020

Scrum master: Victor Hubbers



#### What did we do?

During sprint 1 we decided to focus on the frontend application. This meant that we wanted to (pretty much) finish the pages visually, according to the mock-ups made during sprint 0. We also wanted to connect the Vuex store on these pages, to serve some mock data and make the process of implementing the backend application more easy in the coming sprint.

It was not entirely our decision to wait with the backend application. It was almost impossible to choose another approach, as we had little explanation for the existing Parantion backend. We asked for more explanation, but had not received this within a reasonable period of time. This was discussed during the meetings and as we were about to escalate the problem towards Saxion and Parantion, we got the reply.

After sprint 1 we wanted to have an MVP ready. MVP stands for '**M**inimum **V**iable **P**roduct' and it's purpose is to allow the client to give feedback very early on in the project. We managed to finish enough of the pages to complete this part of the development process. The feedback we received was constructive and gave us more insight into the intended flow of the application. It also helped to smooth out some small mistakes in styling.



#### What went well?

The distribution of tasks went pretty well. We each started on a page by ourselves, then some pages were merged in order to achieve greater visual hierarchy. The first week was purely spent on making pages, but during the second week there were not enough pages left to divide them over all team members. So, we split up the team into three pairs. One pair started orienting themselves on the backend, another pair spent their time on creating the Vuex store and connecting it to the existing pages, while the remaining pair finished the last couple of frontend pages.

The thing that was the most impressive during this sprint, was our communication and focus. We had (almost) daily stand-ups on Monday through Thursday and Saturday, as this fit in the best in everyone's schedules. Every team member made an effort to attend each meeting. Sometimes there was a good reason for someone not to be there, but most times everyone was present. This made for a great working environment in which we helped each other stay motivated. We are proud of this because it is often not the case in group projects.



#### What can we improve on?

The main point of improvement is the communication with the client. It has become clear that it takes some time before we receive an answer to our questions. The biggest example of this, is the earlier mentioned explanation about the Parantion backend. However, this is not the only time we had to wait. 

Within the team we could improve on collaboration. We spent almost all of our time working by ourselves, and then showing each others progress during the next stand-up. It would be beneficial in terms of consistency and code quality to apply the 'four eyes principle' or pair programming.
